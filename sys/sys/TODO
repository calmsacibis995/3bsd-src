/*	TODO	2.1	1/5/80	*/

SMALL, NON-CRITICAL:
	- test rk.c
	- use u_wantcore, u_stklim
	- sys call to get nswap,majorflt,cnswap,cmajorflt
	- support interleaved paging devices, multiple controller paging
	- share text pages at first level
	- write i ptrace is HORRENDOUSLY inefficient for large texts
	- get rid of need for YRCURR in clock.h
	- mem fault on swap-in device error rather than panic
	- use fuller range of p_cpu, p_slptime; use x_slptime
	- count proc i/o's; compute %cpu
	- system assumes that boot clears core past bss (ick)
	- large core dumps are awful and even uninterruptible!
	- should allocate ``buffers'' at boot (in locore) to make
	  vmunix smaller (would save 0:05 in boot time, 48k bytes in vmunix)

NON-PAGING RELATED:
	- IIASA tty mods
	- dma tty i/o (kmc-11a)
