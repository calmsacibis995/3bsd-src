This directory contains software written at UCB to drive a Versatec
36 inch Electrostatic Plotter.  Some of the software is proprietary
and has not been included, but can be obtained from Versatec.

We have the versatec running as a plotter, a printer (four pages
across using the hardware characters), and a typesetter (also
running four pages across).
